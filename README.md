<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Wizard's Castle is a website aimed at new and seasoned Dungeons & Dragons players. It contains resources on rules, characters, monsters and spells in order to help them get into their next game ! All data is fetched from https://www.dnd5eapi.co/ 

This is the second project made during my studies at Wild Code School Paris. The aim was to build a React website based on a public api.

This project uses Harmonia. Harmonia is a framework meant to serve as a foundation for every project following the React-Express-MySQL stack, as learned in Wild Code School.
It's pre-configured with a set of tools which'll help students produce industry-quality and easier-to-maintain code, while staying a pedagogical tool.
